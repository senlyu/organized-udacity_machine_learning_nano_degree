# Micromouse-Capstone-Project

This is a capstone project for udacity machine learning engineer nonadegree.

I design the whole project solution myself, which means I didn't use the most start code given by udacity, but I used showmaze.py for a better visualization.

The project contains:

1. propocal.pdf

2. Capstone Project.pdf

3. code/ maze.py  and showmaze.py  These two are used to show the maze when writing the report
       
4. code/ maze_bench.py  included the code for benchmark. 

5. code/ maze_solveimprove.py is the final solution, contain all the code.

6. code/ maze_benchfree, maze_solvefree are copies which will print path. They could be used if necessary.
